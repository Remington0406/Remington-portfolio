      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>One of my favorite things to do is read—my favorite book series right now is <strong>Wings of Fire</strong>. It's an awesome book series about dragons. There are currently 15 books in the main series(not counting the prequel's or guide books.) </p>
      <p>It’s a fantastic series, and I highly recommend checking it out </p>

      <h3>Drawing</h3>
      <p>I also love to draw, my favorite things to draw are dinosaurs and dragons—some of my other favorite things! Some of my favorite drawings i've made took me almost an hour to draw. I will include an art gallery for some of my drawings.</p>

      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>I also enjoy playing video games on my Xbox; one of my favorite games is <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended.</strong> it is an adventure survival game about dinosaurs where you can build fantasic bases and tame massive prehistoric creatures.</p>

      <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
      <p>I’ve helped people with various things before. For example, I once built a stand-up garden bed for my great-grandma. I’ve also taken care of a blackberry patch by trimming it, removing weeds, and even uprooting a small tree that had started growing in the patch. I also help out a lot with moving heavy items like boxes, furniture, and more. I have also built a website using HTML and CSS(just like this one).</p>
